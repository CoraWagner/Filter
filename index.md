# Filter - Cora Wagner

### What:
The filter tool allows you to easily clean data within Excel. You can quickly remove excess data that does not work for your research, and focalizes the data you want to continue looking at.

### Why:
Someone may choose to use the filter tool when they are working with very large data sets. When there are an abundance of data entries, it becomes time consuming to clean it. Using the filter tool makes it quick and easy to clean a large data set.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/CoraWagner/Filter/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes
