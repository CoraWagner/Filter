# Filter - Cora Wagner

## What:
The filter tool allows you to easily clean data within Excel. You can quickly remove excess data that does not work for your research, and focalize the data you want to continue looking at.

## Why:
Someone may choose to use the filter tool when they are working with very large data sets. When there are an abundance of data entries, it becomes time consuming to clean it. Using the filter tool makes it quick and easy to clean a large data set.

## How:
Here is the data that I started with. There were more cereal options, but for the purpose of this tutorial and the validity of screenshots, I reduced the cereal options. I have kept all data points the same.
